# Super Mario Bros. Remastered for Mac - System requirements
This port is distributed as a Universal 2 binary, with support for both x86_64 Intel and Apple Silicon Macs running macOS 10.15 Catalina or later.

## Compatible Macs (Vulkan renderer)
On macOS 10.15 Catalina to macOS 12 Monterey, SMB1R makes use of the Vulkan rendering engine. While not as fast as native Metal rendering, it supports a much wider range of hardware.

The following Macs are compatible with SMB1R: (only oldest compatible models listed)
- MacBook (Early 2015)
- MacBook Air (Mid 2012)
- MacBook Pro (Mid 2012)

- Mac mini (Late 2012)
- Mac Pro (Late 2013)
- Mac Studio (2022)

## Compatible Macs (Metal 3 renderer)
On macOS 13 Ventura or later, SMB1R uses native Metal 3 rendering, allowing for much higher performance than Vulkan rendering on supported machines.

The following Macs are compatible with Metal 3: (only oldest compatible models listed)
- MacBook (2017)
- MacBook Air (2018)
- MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017) or MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018)
