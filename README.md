### Original source code: https://github.com/JHDev2006/Super-Mario-Bros.-Remastered-Public/

## Downloading
1. Go to the 'Releases' page
2. Look for the latest version
3. Download the .dmg file

## System requirements
This port is built as a Universal 2 binary (natively compatible with Intel and Apple Silicon) and will run on macOS 10.12 Sierra or higher.

Note that not every Mac compatible with macOS Sierra will be able to run this game, due to it using Apple's Metal API for graphics rendering.
