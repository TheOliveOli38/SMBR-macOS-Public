A Remake / Celebration of the original 'Super Mario Bros.' games. Features new levels, custom modes, new characters, alongside a full level editor / custom level system!

## Unofficial macOS Port
Changes made in this repo have been integrated into yuriko-shimizu's [Super Mario Bros. Remastered Public (Mac)](https://github.com/yuriko-shimizu/Super-Mario-Bros.-Remastered-Public-Mac) repository. To download the latest release of SMBR for Mac, please refer to that repo instead.

### Experimental builds
Changes that have not yet been merged to yuriko-shimizu's repository, as well as experimental snapshot builds, can still be found [here](https://github.com/TheOliveOli38/SMBR-macOS-Public/releases).

### Notable changes in the macOS port
- Game title changed from SMB1R to Super Mario Bros. Remastered (Working directory is still named SMB1R)
- Game icon changed to a platform-accurate Liquid Glass icon
- Uses the Metal (macOS 13+) or Vulkan (macOS 10.15-12) renderer instead of OpenGL
- Borderless Windowed mode uses macOS' Extend to Title property for better system integration
- Game starts in Borderless Windowed and Widescreen aspect ratio mode by default
