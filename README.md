## System requirements
This port is built as a Universal 2 binary (natively compatible with Intel and Apple Silicon) and will run on macOS 10.15 Catalina or higher.

### Compatible Macs
This port uses the Metal rendering option, using MoltenVK. Thus, a few Macs compatible with macOS Catalina will not be able to run SMB1R. The oldest compatible machines are:
- MacBook (Early 2015)
- MacBook Air (Mid 2013)
- MacBook Pro (15-inch Mid 2012, NVIDIA) or MacBook Pro (13-inch Late 2013, Intel)
- iMac (Late 2012, NVIDIA) or iMac (Late 2013, Intel)
